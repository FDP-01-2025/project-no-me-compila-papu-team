# Binnacle: Console Cleaning Implementation

## Task Description
Implement console clearing functionality across all games in the project to improve user experience by showing only the current game status instead of the full terminal history.

## What Was Done

### 1. Project Synchronization (Previous Task)
- Converted main project to match secondary project structure
- Replaced complex multi-game system with SuperTriviaGame focus
- Updated README.md to simple format
- Replaced main.cpp with simple SuperTriviaGame implementation
- Added all necessary files from secondary project
- Updated Makefile for new project structure
- Cleaned up old files and dependencies

### 2. Console Cleaning Implementation
Added `clearConsole()` function to each game with cross-platform support:

```cpp
void clearConsole() {
    #ifdef _WIN32
        system("cls");
    #else
        system("clear");
    #endif
}
```

#### Games Modified:
1. **Hangman** - Clear screen after each guess
2. **TicTacToe** - Clear screen after each move (player and computer)
3. **Rock Paper Scissors** - Clear screen before showing results
4. **Crossword** - Clear screen after each correct word found
5. **SuperTriviaGame** - Clear screen at start, between questions, and at results

## Architecture Principles Followed

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Used preprocessor directives for Windows/Unix systems
2. **Consistent Implementation**: Same clearConsole() pattern across all games
3. **User Experience Focus**: Clean interface showing only current game state
4. **Minimal Code Changes**: Added functionality without breaking existing logic
5. **Git Best Practices**: Meaningful commit messages and proper branching

## Technical Details

### Implementation Strategy:
- Added clearConsole() function to each game class
- Called clearConsole() at strategic points (after user input, before displaying results)
- Maintained game flow while improving visual clarity
- Preserved all existing functionality

### Files Modified:
- `src/Hangman.cpp` - Added clearConsole() and called in drawState()
- `src/TicTacToe.cpp` - Added clearConsole() and called after each move
- `src/RPSGame.cpp` - Added clearConsole() and called in drawHands()
- `src/Crossword.cpp` - Added clearConsole() and called after correct answers
- `src/SuperTriviaGame.cpp` - Added clearConsole() and called at multiple points

## Results
- All games now have clean console output
- User experience significantly improved
- No functionality was broken during implementation
- Project compiles and runs successfully
- All changes committed with realistic commit messages

## Next Steps
The project is now ready for further development with a clean, user-friendly interface across all games.
